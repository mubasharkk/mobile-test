Although the object is attached to the global scoped `navigator`, it is not available until after the `deviceready` event.

    document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
    function onDeviceReady() {
        console.log({{device-ready-warning-obj}});
    }


## Installation

This requires cordova 5.0+

    cordova plugin add {{npmName}}
Older versions of cordova can still install via the __deprecated__ id

    cordova plugin add {{cprName}}
It is also possible to install via repo url directly ( unstable )

    cordova plugin add {{repoUrl}}.git

## This documentation is generated by a tool

:warning: Run `npm install` in the plugin repo to enable automatic docs generation if you plan to send a PR.  
[jsdoc-to-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc-to-markdown) is used to generate the docs.  
Documentation consists of template and API docs produced from the plugin JS code and should be regenerated before each commit (done automatically via [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky), running `npm run gen-docs` script as a `precommit` hook - see `package.json` for details).
